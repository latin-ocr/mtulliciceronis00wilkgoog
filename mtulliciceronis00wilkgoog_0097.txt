84 M. TULLI CICERONIS

soles, Catule, ‘non rebar’ aut ‘opinabar ς’ aut alia multa, quibus
loco positis grandior atque antiquior oratio saepe videri solet.
154 Novantur autem verba, quae ab e0, qui dicit, ipso gignuntur ac
fiunt, vel coniungendis verbis, ut haec:
tuni pavor sapientiam ornnem mi exanimato expectorat. 5
num non vis huius me versutiloquas malitias .....
videtis enim et ‘versutiloquas’ et ‘expectorat' ex coniunctione
sacta esse verba, non nata3 sed saepe vel sine coniunctione verba
novantur ut ille ‘senius desertus,’ ut ‘di genitales‚’ ut ‘bacarum

1. rebar, 58²· M have verebar: loquae': but it is probable that Cicero
‘fortasse verior est scriptura‚' Ell. which 1 was quoting srom memory and inexactly,
do not understand. Surelyvcrcorisinno as Madvig says. Hence this line is
way archaic. Cp. Cat. M. 37. doubtless by Accius, and may have come

opinabar: here it cau only be the from the play ‘Armorum iudicium’: it
tense which is in question : it is quoted would well suit Ajax, speaking oi the wily
only lrom Plaut. Pers. ii. 3. 5, until Suet. eloquence os Ulysses. But there is no
Tit. 6. 'l’he form ‘opinor' is common other evidence that it does. Nonius, p.
enough iu Cicero. 189 M. quotes in the form ‘annum novis

2. loeo, ‘in their proper place! Brut. huius v. m.’ whence Ribbeck (Incert. inc
274‘nullum [verbum] nisi loco positum:' Fab. 114) proposed to read ‘an non
ad Fam. ix. 16. 4 ‘posuisti loco versus novisti‘ etc. a reading adopted by Pid.

Attianos! Sometimes in is added3 cp.
Roby, § 1171.

4 val coniungendis: there is an ana-
coluthon, the ‘vel' having nothing to
correspond to it but ‘sed saepe!

5. expectoret is a newly coined word,
for ‘removes from my breast,' Non. 16, 7
‘expectorare est extra pectus eicere.' He
quotes this passage from the Alcumaeo of
Ennius (given more fully in ξ 218), and
also from Accius, Phoenissae (595 Rt
‘incusant ultro; a fortuna opibusque
omnibus Ι desertum, abiectum, afflictum
exanimum expectoraut‚' and from his
Epigoni (301 R) ‘eloquere propere, ac
meum hunc pavorem expectora' Cp.
Quint. viii. 3. 31 ‘ut veteres ne expectorat
quidem timuerunt, et sane eiusdem aetatis
est exanimat) The use of the word in
the sense in which its modern derivatives
are usually employed (=exscreatio), or as
meaning ‘the utterance of one's whole
feelings‚' as sometimes in French and
Germanis barbarous. Cp. Krebs·Schmalz,
Antib. s. v.

6. Ν 11111 non vis, etc. Cic. de Fin. iv.
68 says ‘ex ea difficultate illa fallacilo-
uae, ut ait Accius, malitiae natae sunt.'
it is an absurd suggestion os Goerenz‚
that we should there read ‘versuti-

and Harn. With the reading os the MSS.
some verb like punire is understood3
in either ease huius is a monosyllable‚
as osten iu comedy, and as in both the
other instances‚ quoted from early tragedy
(Acc.152, 294 Ribb.: in Enu. Cresph.
116 R. 339 L. M. the reading varies
between huic and huius). The line is
robably an iambic tetrameter with the ·
last measure wanting. In Orat. 164
Cicero says ‘immo vero ista (sc. verba
bene sonantia) sequamur asperitatemque
fugiamus itemque versutiloquas malitias!

8. faute, ‘coined' §§ 165, 184, ii. 36:
cp. Orat. 68 ‘licentiam statuo maiorem
esse [poetis] quam in nobis faciendorum
iungendorumque verborum* with Sandys’
note.

sad saepe, soA H γ etc. vel sappi ⁴
seems only a correction to keep up e
regularity ol the construction.

91119 senius desertus, ‘that phrase
senius d.' For ille agreeing with the word
quoted cp. note on ii. 193. Α H‘ have
‘desertus,’ which may stand, though it is
much corrupted in other MSS. The word
was probably coined by Ennius, as we
know to have been the casewith genitalis.

In ordinary Latin the form is senium: ·

but in Ter. Eun. 301 we have ‘nt illum
