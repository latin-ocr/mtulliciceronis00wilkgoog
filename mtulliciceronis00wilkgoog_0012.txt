’ NOTICE

ΙΝ issuing at last the completion of this edition of the
De Oratore, Ι have to express my hearty thanks to the
Delegates of the Clarendon Press for the tolerance which
they have shown to a long delay; and for the great care
and skill of the officials of the Press in producing the work.

I have once more to repeat my acknowledgements of deep ’

obligation to Dr. J. S. Reid for his learned and acute

suggestions which have so often thrown light on passages
of difficulty. And Ι have to recognise gratefully the kind·
ness of Mr. Ε. Maunde Thompson in facilitating the
preparation os a faesimile of the important Harleian MS.
