44 M. TULLI CICERONIS

so sin aliquis exstiterit aliquando, qui Aristotelio more de omnibus
rebus in utramque partem possit dicere et in omni causa duas
contrarias orationeS, praeceptis illius cognitis, explicare aut hoc
Arcesilae modoet Carneadi contra omne, quod propositum sit,
disserat, quique ad eam rationem adiungat hunc [rhetoricum]5
usum [moremque] exercitationemque dicendi, is sit verus, is
perfectus, is solus orator. Nam neque sine forensibus nervis satis
vehemens et gravis nec sine varietate doctrinae satis politus et
81 sapiens esse orator potest. Qua re Coracem istum veterem
patiamur nos quidem pullos suos excludere in nido, qui evolent ιο
clamatores odiosi ac molesti, Pamphilumque nescio quem sina-

tacito dumtaxat convicio,' and 27 ‘mirifi-
cam mihi verberationem cessationis epis·
tola dedisti‚' where the construction is on
the analogy of that of poenas dare. The
MSS. give ‘istos quidem nostros,' whichgis
quite indefensible. Kaysersimply brackets
nestros with all editors since Ernesti; Sorof
reads doctos, Adler magistros, Reid much
more plausibly otiosos (cp. i. 219). If ·os
were once omitted byacopyist, the further
corruption would be very natural, espe-
cially after ⁴ quidem!

1. exstiterit. . . ait: Ι see no reason
whatever for changing sit of the MSS. into
crit with Bake, Kayser, and Sorof, and
taking exstiterit as fut perf. ind. It is
quite natural to regard the appearance of
an ideal orator as a more imaginary and
unreal hypothesis than the dispute of a
practised orator with a mere philosopher ;
hence verberabit need not determine the
construction of the next clause. Cp. i. 214.

Aristotelio more, i.e. in the way
of continuous exposition, which Cicero (de
Fin. ii. 1. 3) tells us was usual between
the time of Socrates (ie. the Platonic
Socrates) and Arcesilas. For the dia·
logues of Aristotle cp. Introd. p. 3. Cicero
does not mean that Aristotle was accus·
tomed to argue on both sides of any case,
but that there were two ways of training
argumentative skill, either by composing
continuous discourses like those of Aris-
totle, ou both sides, or by arguing against
any thesis propounded, as the New Aea-
demy did.

3. praeceptis illius cognitis may
contain a reference to Ar. Rhet. i. 1. ra

τάναντία δεῖ δύνασθαι πείθειν. For the
practice of composing speeches on op-
posite sides ofa case cp. Introd. p. 31.

5. huno unum exercitationemque:
this is unquestionably the right restoration
of the corrupt MS. reading.

‘de vera et perfecta [amicitia] loquor,

7. forensibus nervia, ‘the energy re-
quired6iu public speaking,' ii. 64: cp.
Orat. 2.

9. Coracem: Introd. p. 26.

iatum veterem, a good emendation
of Bake's for the indefensible vestrum of
the MSS. ‘ vester dicitur, quod colloquio
prioris diei commemoratus erati. 20. 91,'
Henr. But he had been mentioned by
Antonius; and vester could not possibly
mean ‘of whom you, my friends, have
heard ε’ it would necessarily imply that
he had some special connexion with two
or more of the audience. As the earliest
professor of the art of rhetoric he might
well be called vetus.

10. pullos,‘chicks,'of course withaplay
on the meaning of κόραξ, ‘crow’ (not a
r raven,’ as Mr. W. W. Fowler has shown).

excludere, ‘hatch,' the regular word
(cp. Mayor on Cic. de Nat. D. ii. 124),
though excudere is often used by the
scriptores rerum rusticarum (ib. 1²9)-

11. Pamphilum. One Pamphilus (Ar-
istoph. Plut. 385 and the Schol.) was a
painter, the teacher of Apelles, and an
accomplished man (Plin. H. N. xxxv. 76
Dat), especially in mathematics. An·
other of the same name is mentioned by
