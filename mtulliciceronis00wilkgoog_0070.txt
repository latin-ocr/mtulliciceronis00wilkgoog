‚on carrona ΠΙ. 57

etiam ad extenuandum atque abiciendum. Id desideratur omni· 2³1
bus eis in locis, quos ad fidem orationis faciendam adhiberi dixit
Antonius, vel curn explanamus aliquid vel cum conciliamus

amplificatio potest plurimum, eaque una laus oratoris est [et]
propria maxime. Etiam maior est illa exercitatio quam extremo
sermone instruxit Antonius, primo reiciebat, laudandi et vitu-

6. [et] incl. Pearcius KS: et ch Fr. 7. etiam maior est ω KP: adhibenda etiamest S.

s. abiciendum, ‘disparage,' almost
synonymous here with ‘extenuandum’
and quite different from its meaning in
§ron

3. locis, ‘lines of argument’ (ii. ml:
cp. Top. a. 8 ‘Itaque licet definire locum
esse argumenti sedem, argumentum autem
rationem, quae rei dubiae faciat fidem!

orationis: ‘the dative after fides
and fiducia (even when unconnected
with sarcre or other verbs) is rare in good
prose‘ Reid ou Aead. ii. 19 ‘dum ad-
spectus ipse fidem faciat sni iudici': cp.
Madvig on de Fin. ii. 27. The editors
are wrong who alter the MS. reading to
‘orationi'

4. vel. . .ch . . .vel: the usual three-
fold division: ii. 114.

6. eaque una laus, viz. ‘concitandi
animos!

7. propria maxime: so Brut. 32²
‘nem0, qui animum eius, quod unum est
oratoris maxime proprium, quocumque
res postularet, (posset) impellere: ib. 276
‘duo summe tenuit (Calidius), ut et rem
illustraret disserendo, et animos eorum,
qui audirent, devinciret voluptate: aberat
tertla illa laus, qua permoveret atque in-
citaret animes, quam plurimum pollere
diximus'

Etiam maior est, ete The read-
ing of the MSS. here cau hardly be de-
fended. The only natural translation is
‘still greater (i. e. more important) is the
practice,' etc. Greater than what? Than
amplificatio. But it is one means of
amplificatio, a species under the genus,
with which it cannot therefore be com·
pared. Ell.'s note—‘ cavendum ne cum
sono pronuntiemus maior, re prona prop·
ter additum etiam'—recognises the diffi-
culty, but does not do much to remove it.
Pid. argues that the notion of another
‘exercitatio‚' with which the ‘erc lau-
dandi et vituperandi' can be compared,

is suggested by the mention of the special
merit ‘concitare amplificando,'anrl shows ,
from Brut. 47-‘ (Gorgias) quem (dicunt)
singularum renim laudes vituperationes
que conscripsisse, quod iudicarat hoe
oratoris esse maxime proprium, rem au·
gere posse laudando vituperandoque rur·
sus affligere ‘-that ⁴ laudare et vituperare
was a most important means for the
‘amplificatio’ But it does not follow
that Cicero, after saying that the exciting
of the emotions was the sphere in which
amplification was most effective, could
proceed to say that panegyric and its
opposite were of still more importauce:
they are of importanee simply as exciting
the emotions. The attempt has been
made to interpret ‘etiam' as ‘further'
and ‘maior' as ‘rather important,' which
is quite inconsistent with ‘nihil est . ..
accommodatius? Sorof boldly cuts ont
‘maior' and prefixes ‘adhibenda' This
is a counsel of despair; though it restores
sense to what seems otherwise barely
explicable. So does Kayser's ‘quae
etiam maior est illa exercitatione, quam. . .
reiciebat, adhibita,' and ou the whole it
is easier to explain the corruption, if this
were the original reading. Reid suggests
that ‘magna res est’ may have been
corrupted through ‘magnarest' But I
agree with Bake: ‘quomodo haec vitia
corrigenda sint, prorsus nihil video!

extremo: ii. 342-349.

8. primo, ii. 43 ff. The latter expres·
sion is not quite exact. a at first said
that panegyric needed no special rules,
and ‘put it aside,' as he says: afterwards
he lays down the proper objects of
panegyric. There is no difficulty, as
Bake supposes, in the use of ‘ instruere'
for ‘to fit out’ without the mention of
that which is furnished: this is often left
to be supplied from the context. Here
we may understand ‘artis praeceptis!
