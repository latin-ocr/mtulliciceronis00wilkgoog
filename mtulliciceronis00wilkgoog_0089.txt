3. non boni: cp. Xen. Mem. i. a. 12
‘⁴ Ἀλλ’,” ἔφη ηε ὁ κατήγορος, “ Σωκράτει
όμιλητὰγενομένωΚριτίας τε καίἈλκιβιάδης
πλεῖστα κακὰ τὴν πόλιν ἐποιησάτην. Κρι·
τίας μὲν γὰρ τῶν ἓν τῇ ὀλιγαρχίᾳ πάντων

Ἀλκιβιάδης δὲ αὖ τῶν ἐν τῇ δημοκρατίᾳ
πάντων ἀκρατέστατος καὶ ὑβριστότατος καί
βιαιότατος.” Xenophon goes on to argue
that Socrates was not responsible for the
vices of Critias and Alcibiades, but did
his best to reform them' Cp. too Plat.
Apol. 33 A. Aeschines, in Tim. 173,
says ἔπειθ’ ὑμεῖς, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, Σωκράτην
τὸν σοφιστὴν ἀπεκτείνατε, ’ότι Κριτίαν
ἐφάνη πεπαιδευκώς, though this is doubt·
less a rhetorical exaggeration rather than
a sober statement. As both were Athe·
nians, Bergk’s conjecture ‘civibus’ for
‘civitatibus' seems plausible.

5. Dionem: the character of Dio and
the nature of Plato’s influence upon him
are admirably discussed by 'Grote, c.
lxxxiv.

eam laudem doctrinae et ingeni gloriam
adiecit.' Isocrates, writing after his
death, gives a full account oi his public
services and high qualitiesin xv. 101-139.

11. Lysis (the MSS. have Lysias or
some corrupted form of the name) of
Tarentum took shelter at Thebes, ‘hom
causes which we cannot make out,' after
the suppression of the Pythagoream
brotherhood, and there ‘Epaminondas
not only heard him as a pupil, but
tended him almost as a son, during the
close of an aged life' (Grote, vii. 107).
According to some authorities he was
himself a pupil of Pythagoras, but that
is chronologically impossible. He is
said to have escaped with Archippus,
when the other Pythagoreaus were bumt
to death in a house at Croton, by Cylon
(cp. Grote, iii. 350). Bentley ou Pha-
laris (i. 142), assumes that this must have
been an earlier philosopher of the name t
Zeller, Phil. d. Gr. i². 239 (vol. i. p. 35η
