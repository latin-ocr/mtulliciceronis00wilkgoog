DE ΘΚΑ TORE III.

me quidem istius sermonis participem factum esse gaude03 ac
vellem ut meus gener, sodalis tuus, Hortensius, adfuisset3 quem
quidem ego confido omnibus istis laudibus, quas tu oratione aas

complexus es, excellentem sore’

Et Crassus ‘iore dicis?’ inquit,

5‘ego vero esse iam iudico et tum iudicavi, cum me consule in
senatu causam defendit Africae nuperque etiam magis, cum pro
Bithyniae rege dixit. Quam ob rem recte vides, Catule3 nihil
enim isti adulescenti neque a natura neque a doctrina deesse
sentio: quo magis est tibi, Cotta, et tibi, Sulpici, vigilandum ac 230
10 laborandum3 non enim ille mediocris orator vestrae quasi suc-
crescit aetati, sed et ingenio peracri et studio flagranti et doctrina
eximia et memoria singulari3 cui quamquam faveo, tamen illum

a. vellem ut...adfuiaset: so most
MSS. including A EH. lt is very rare
ior Cicero to insert ut in such cases. But
he has ‘mallem ut ires’ in Att. i. 16, 14,
‘vellem ut pedes haberent’ in Famvii. 31.
2, ‘vellem ut. . . potuisset' in pro Sull. 1,
‘vellem ut imitarentur' in Phil. viii. 31,
and ‘volo ut respondeas' in Vat. five
times (14, 17,18, 21, 29); so it is better
to follow the MSS. Cp. Kiihner, ii. 527,
Draeger, ii. ²49·

a. gener: this connexion is not men·

5. inaenatn. Nothingfurtheris known
of these orations. Africa was made into
a province in nc. 146, and in ne. 95
there was probably some reason to com·
plain of misgovernment. Nicomedes ΙΙ
of Bithynia shortlyafterthis date attempted
to establish a claim sor Cappadocia against
Mithridates on behali of an impostor,
whom he pretended to be ason oi his
wile Laodice, the widow os me previous
king Ariarathes VI. The claim was re-
jected. Cp. Justin. xxxviii. 1, a, Clinton,
F ast. iii. 419, or Mommsen, iii. 187. lt
was doubtless in support os this claim
that Hortensius pleaded in the senate.

8. a, ‘in respect oi? For the ora·
tory oi Hortensius, cp. Brut. 228 ‘Q.
Hortensiiadmodumaduleseentis ingenium
nt Phidiae signum simul aspectum et
probatum est. Is L. Crasso Q. Scaevola
consulibus primum in foro dixit et apud
hos ipsos quidem consules, et cum eornm
qui adfuerunt, tum ipsorum consulum qui
omnes intellegentia anteibant, iudicio dis·

cessit probatus. Undeviginti annos natus

erat eo tempore? See also the fuller ac· ¹

count in Brut. 301 ff. The special points
commended are his extraordinary memory,
his ambition, his constant practice, his
skill in arrangement, his carefully selected
and yet copious diction (‘eaque erat
cum summo ingenio tum exercitationibus
maximis consecutus ’), his agreeable voice,
and studied grace oi delivery which ‘etiam
plus,artis habebat, quam erat oratori
satis.

10. non ille, etc, ‘it is no ordinary
orator who is growing up in him to
succeed your generation, but one oi,’ etc.
This use oi aetas sor ‘menos a generation’
or rather ‘oi a particular time of liie’
(Hortensius was ten years younger than
Sulplcins and Cotta), is very rare in Cicero,
and became common only in poetry and
in post-Augustan prose. But it is not so
entirely restricted to these as L. δι S.
would imply: cp. pro Mil. 77 ‘multas
tamen victorias aetas nostra vidit ’ς Pht.
xi. 39 ‘aetas succedit aetati ἐ in Verr. ii.
181 ‘in publicanorum causis vel plurimum
aetatis meaeversor' is perhaps ambiguous ;
and pro Marc. 9 ‘nec ulla unquam aetas
de tuis laudibus conticescet' may show
a trace of later Latinity. It is impossible
always to draw the line between the ab·
straet and the collective use os the word,
and the former is iairly common in Cicero,
though iar less common than the meaning
‘time oi life? Cp. ‘haec aetas' Rep. ir.
19, ‘nostra aetas· ib. v. a, ‘omnis aetas'
de Div. i. 37, ‘alia ex alia aetas,’ de Am.
101, etc.
