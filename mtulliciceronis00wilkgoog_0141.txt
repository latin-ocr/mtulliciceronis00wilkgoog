M. TULLI CICERONIS

et Atreus fere totus. Aliud miseratio ac maeror, flexibile, ple-

num, interruptum, flebili voce:

quo nunc me vortam? quod iter incipiam ingredi?
domum patemamne? anne ad Peliae filias?

et illa

o pater, o patria, 0 Priami domus!

et quae sequuntur

haec omnia videi inflammarei,

Priamo vi vitam evitarei.

aas aliud metus, demissum et haesitans et abiectum:

multis sum modis circumventus morbo, exsilio atque inopia:
tum pavor sapientiam omnem mi exanimato expectorat3
mater terribilem minatur vitae cruciatum et necem,

quae nemo est tam firmo ingenio et tanta confidentia,

quin refugiat timido sanguen atque exalbescat metu.

keep the future of M. Key held that the
older writers used vort· in the imperfect,
vert· in the perfect tenses, and that this dis·
tinction is preserved in the MSS., though
ellaced by editors: cp. Trans. Phil. Soc.
1860-61, p. 19²· I have observed very
many cases in Plautus in which this holds
good, bnt should not like to assert it
universally: the only instance in Terence
against it is Eun. 343 when Umpfenbach
reads aduerterat without noting any varia-
tion. Cp. Phorm. 909, Heaut. 656.
Stolz² p. 258 says that it is impossible
to say whether vert· or vora· is the older;
cp. Classical Review, i. 148 -vinoita

3. quo nnnc, etc„ from the Medea of
Ennius (fr. x. Ribb.)‚ translated from
Eurip. Med. 502 νῦν ποΐ spondam adrepe
πρὸς πατρὸς δόμους, oris ool προδοῦσα καὶ
πάτραν damippus ἢπρῢςτολοίνοςΠελιάδας;
araus γ’ ἂν οὖν δέξαιντό μ’ οἴκοις ὧν ποτέρα

mauram. There is a double rendering
of the first three words, as often in early
tragedy.

6. o pater, ete: § 102.

8. videi: M read videt and evitaret,
which is strong evidence, as Stangl has
noriced, that the diphthong was used here.

9. evitaret: this word, not found else·
where, gives strong support to Prof.
N ettleship's derivation of invitare, ‘to put
life into z cp. Journ. Phil. v. οι. The
alliteration is noteworthy.

11. multis, 5154: from the Alcumaeo
of Ennius (fr. ii. Ribb, cp. Rdm. Trag. p.
197). The conjecture ‘multimodis sumcir-
cumventns’ (cp. Orat. 153) was a natural
one (L has multis modz's sum) approved
by Dr. Merry (Fragments p. 49): the
form is actually found in Pacuv. 307 R., iu
Plautus (often τ cp. Brix on Trin. 931) and
Lucretius (cp. Munro on i. 638), but not
in Ennius except here by conjecture: hence
correct Sandys on Orat. l. c.. where Corssen
ii.2 655 has misled him. (Corssen also
falsely quotes triadis multis from Lucret. i.
726.) Lucian Miiller adopts it here: cp.
‘Ennius' p. 258, and ‘Enni Reliquiae’ p.
231 (Trag. fr. 236). Plautus would not
have hesitated to use maritabat I can quote
no parallel from tragedy, except ‘dorni
staut,’ if that is sound, from Ennius Au·
drom. Aechm. 78. Ell.'s notion that
modis is a monosyllable is obsolete.

13. mater: Alcmaeon slew his mother
Eriphyle, and was haunted by the Erinyes.

14. quas: there is an anacoluthon, and
it does not much matter whether we say
that quae is fem. nom. with Pid. (‘quae
nex eius modi est ut') or nent aec..
object to an anticipated transitive verb.
The latter is much the more common
usage.

15. sanguen is the best established
reading (so sanguis in de Fin. v. ,alhand is
better in itself than Ell.'s sanguine: the
